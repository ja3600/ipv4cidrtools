# cidrtools
As a learning excercise I wrote this Flask app utilizing the awesome netaddr Python library. Designed as subnetting tool for network engineers.

# About
*CIDR Tools* is an app to assist in network address planning/design. I wanted to learn the basics of writing a python-based web application and at the same time have a simple tool to use.  This application has the following functions:
- Disector - this takes any IPv4 address in CIDR form and shows details about it
- Subnet - is used to break up a parent network into subnets based on a new desired prefix length
- Supernet - is to show what parent networks a subnet belongs to
- Summary - given a list of hosts and/or networks, produce the summary prefix(s)
- Splitnet (in progress) - show the prefix summaries after splitting up a prefix

The results are provided in an HTML table, so data is easily cut/paste into a spreadsheet or other forms of documentation.

# Future Plans
Create forms to generate complex IP address design schemas base on a design template. For example, a design template could represent a branch office, floors in a building or large campus.  The addressing schemas could then be imported into an IPAM solution such as Netbox or Infoblox.  


# Testing in macOS

## Make sure your system is already setup with Python 3.12, pip and git

## Clone the repo (it will create a application folder called "cidrtools")
    
    git clone https://github.com/ja3600/ipv4cidrtools.git

## Change into the directory:

    cd ipv4cidrtools

## Create a virtual environment, activate and use Pip to install required Python packages:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Run it baby! 

(venv) ipv4cidrtools %flask run

## point your local browser to

# Container Install and Setup (these are probably outdated)

Used this great tutorial:
https://blog.entirely.digital/docker-gunicorn-and-flask/


Assumptions: Your system is already setup and running Docker version  13.1 or higher


First, clone the repo (it will create a application folder called "cidrtools")
    
    git clone https://github.com/ja3600/cidrtools.git

Change into the directory:

    cd cidrtools

Build the container (this uses the Dockerfile):

    docker build --tag flask_cidrtools .

Run it (first time) detached, as a daemon
    
    docker run --name cidrtools -d -p 5000:5000 flask_cidrtools 

Run it (first time) to see debug errors..
    
    docker run --name cidrtools -p 5000:5000 flask_cidrtools 

Stop or start it:

    docker stop cidrtools
    docker start cidrtools

Other useful Docker commands:

    docker ps -a
    docker images -a
    docker system prune
    
Login into the container (by running bash):

    docker exec -u root -t -i cidrtools /bin/bash

Copy files to a container:

    docker cp src_filename.txt cidrtools:/dst_filename.txt

Delete all containers and images:

    docker ps -a -q | xargs docker rm
    docker images -a -q | xargs docker rmi -f




# Legacy instructions that worked in 2020

These instructions are based on CentOS Linux release 7.7
These steps assume your system already has python3 and pip installed
This is handy if you are developing/testing new code


Install virtual environment:

    pip install virtualenv --user


Create a new environment for Flask:

    virtualenv flask-env


Activate the new environment:

    source flask-env/bin/activate


Clone the cidr-tools files from Github:

    https://github.com/ja3600/ipv4cidrtools.git

This will create a new directory called cidrtools.


Move into this new directory

    cd cidrtools


Now install Flask and other dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements


Allow port TCP 5000 through the Linux firewall, if required:

    firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=5000/tcp 
    firewall-cmd --reload


Run the application...

    python3 app/app.py


To enable the Flask environment automatically when you log in:

Add this line to the end of your .bashrc

    cd ~
    source ~/flask-env/bin/activate
